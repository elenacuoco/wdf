Welcome to Wavelet Detection Filter's documentation!
============================================================


The library covers the application of the Wavelet Detection Filter (WDF) on the time-series data. The core part of the wdf is based on the
WDF implementation p4TSA developed by Elena Cuoco(see p4TSA github repository https://github.com/elenacuoco/p4TSA/).
p4TSA can be wrapped in Python and within this library it is denoted by `pytsa`.
